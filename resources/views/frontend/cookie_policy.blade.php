<div><strong><span data-custom-class="heading_1">What are cookies?</span></strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span data-custom-class="body_text">Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by website owners in order to make their websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span data-custom-class="body_text">Cookies set by the website owner (in this case,&nbsp;<strong>localfreshfoods.co.uk</strong>) are called &ldquo;first party cookies&rdquo;. Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called &ldquo;third party cookies&rdquo;. Third party cookies enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g. like advertising, interactive content and analytics). The parties that set these third party cookies can recognize your computer both when it visits the website in question and also when it visits certain other websites.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong><span data-custom-class="heading_1">Why do we use cookies?</span></strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><span data-custom-class="body_text">Cookies are not the only way&nbsp;</span><span data-custom-class="body_text">to recognize or track visitors to a website. We may use other, similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons (sometimes called &ldquo;tracking pixels&rdquo; or &ldquo;clear gifs&rdquo;). These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognize when someone has visited our Websites or opened an e-mail including them. This allows us, for example, to monitor&nbsp;</span><span data-custom-class="body_text">the traffic patterns of users from one page within a website to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to the website from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to improve site performance, and to measure the success of e-mail marketing campaigns. In many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly, and so declining cookies will impair their functioning.</span></div>
