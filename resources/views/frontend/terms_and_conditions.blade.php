                Use; (4) any breach of your representations and warranties set forth in these Terms of Use; (5) your violation of
                the rights of a third party, including but not limited to intellectual property rights; or (6) any overt harmful act
                toward any other user of the Site or the Marketplace Offerings with whom you connected via the Site. Notwithstanding
                the foregoing, we reserve the right, at your expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter for
                which you are required to indemnify us, and you agree to cooperate, at your expense, with our defense of such
                claims. We will use reasonable efforts to notify you of any such claim, action, or proceeding which is subject to
                this indemnification upon becoming aware of it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p data-custom-class="heading_1"><strong>USER DATA</strong>&nbsp;</p>
            <p data-custom-class="body_text">We will maintain certain data that you transmit to the Site for the purpose of managing
                the performance of the Marketplace Offerings, as well as data relating to your use of the Marketplace Offerings.
                Although we perform regular routine backups of data, you are solely responsible for all data that you transmit or
                that relates to any activity you have undertaken using the Marketplace Offerings. You agree that we shall have no
                liability to you for any loss or corruption of any such data, and you hereby waive any right of action against us
                arising from any such loss or corruption of such data.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p data-custom-class="heading_1"><strong>ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS, TRANSACTIONS, AND SIGNATURES</strong>&nbsp;</p>
            <p data-custom-class="body_text">Visiting the Site, sending us emails, and completing online forms constitute electronic
                communications. You consent to receive electronic communications, and you agree that all agreements, notices,
                disclosures, and other communications we provide to you electronically, via email and on the Site, satisfy any legal
                requirement that such communication be in writing. YOU HEREBY AGREE TO THE USE OF ELECTRONIC SIGNATURES, CONTRACTS,
                ORDERS, AND OTHER RECORDS, AND TO ELECTRONIC DELIVERY OF NOTICES, POLICIES, AND RECORDS OF TRANSACTIONS INITIATED OR
                COMPLETED BY US OR VIA THE SITE. You hereby waive any rights or requirements under any statutes, regulations, rules,
                ordinances, or other laws in any jurisdiction which require an original signature or delivery or retention of
                non-electronic records, or to payments or the granting of credits by any means other than electronic means.&nbsp;

            <p data-custom-class="heading_1"><strong>MISCELLANEOUS</strong>&nbsp;</p>
            <p data-custom-class="body_text">These Terms of Use and any policies or operating rules posted by us on the Site or in
                respect to the Marketplace Offerings constitute the entire agreement and understanding between you and us. Our
                failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Use shall not operate as a waiver of such
                right or provision. These Terms of Use operate to the fullest extent permissible by law. We may assign any or all of
                our rights and obligations to others at any time. We shall not be responsible or liable for any loss, damage, delay,
                or failure to act caused by any cause beyond our reasonable control. If any provision or part of a provision of
                these Terms of Use is determined to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that provision or part of the provision is
                deemed severable from these Terms of Use and does not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining
                provisions. There is no joint venture, partnership, employment or agency relationship created between you and us as
                a result of these Terms of Use or use of the Marketplace Offerings. You agree that these Terms of Use will not be
                construed against us by virtue of having drafted them. You hereby waive any and all defenses you may have based on
                the electronic form of these Terms of Use and the lack of signing by the parties hereto to execute these Terms of
                Use.</p>
